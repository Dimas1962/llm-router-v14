- Rollback to previous states

## Model Selection Examples

From stress test observations:

| Strategy | Selected Model | Reason |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| QUALITY_FOCUSED | `qwen3-next-80b` | Highest Eagle ELO rating (0.710) |
| COST_AWARE | `qwen2.5-coder-7b` | Most cost-effective within budget |
| CASCADE | `qwen2.5-coder-7b` | Tier-based selection |
| BALANCED | `qwen3-next-80b` | Hybrid Eagle/CARROT decision |

## Scalability

### Concurrent Performance
- **10 concurrent requests:** 7.84 QPS
- **Linear scaling** up to system limits
- **Semaphore-based** concurrency control
- **Graceful degradation** under load

### Load Adaptation
- **LOW load:** Quality-focused routing

## Comparison: v1.4 vs v2.0

### v1.4 RouterCore
✓ 8 components
✓ Basic routing with quality prediction
✓ Lightweight and fast
✓ Production-ready core functionality

### v2.0 Unified Router
✓ 21 components (v1.4 + 10 new)
✓ Advanced features:
  - Context caching and management
  - Quality verification and auto-retry
  - State snapshots
  - Batching layer
  - AST analysis
  - Hierarchical pruning
  - Environment-aware prompting

✓ Better quality at similar performance
✓ Significantly more features
✓ Enterprise-ready capabilities

## Recommendations

### Use v2.0 Unified Router when:
- Quality is critical (automatic verification + retry)
- Need context caching (reduces redundant work)
- Require state snapshots (debugging, rollback)
- Want environment-aware prompting
- Need comprehensive monitoring

### Use v1.4 RouterCore when:
- Minimal overhead required
- Basic routing sufficient
- Resource-constrained environment
- Simple deployment preferred

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Batching optimization** - Fine-tune batch sizes based on throughput
2. **Cache warming** - Preload common queries
3. **Model performance tracking** - Long-term ELO evolution
4. **Cost tracking** - Real-time budget management
5. **A/B testing framework** - Compare routing strategies

### Production Deployment
1. Configure quality thresholds per use case
2. Set up monitoring dashboards
3. Tune cache size for workload
4. Configure snapshot retention policies
5. Set concurrency limits based on infrastructure
